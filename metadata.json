  "description": "This template and YouTube video goes over5 different implementations of evaluations within n8n. * Categorization * Correctness * Tools used * String similarity * HelpfulnessYou’ll learn when to use each type, how to set up test datasets in Google Sheetsor data tables, and how to track your results over time. I also explain bestpractices like only changing one variable at a time, documenting your promptsand model settings, and building proper training datasets with enough examplesto confidently validate your workflow.YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4LXYOhQ-Z0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4LXYOhQ-Z0]Thank you for downloading our free n8n Evaluations template.
